I always had an eye for the W114 Mercedes chassis and when one came up for sale, I scooped it up once the owner dropped the price. The owner before him put in a carbureted chevy small block 305 which was terribly under powered, so naturally, that had to go. I decided to go with the classic aluminum LS6 series chevy engine due to its cheap and easy power output. The build was pretty straightforward - simple boltons, a cam, fresh heads, and a tune would bring the power of the car right to 420 horsepower. I had few initial hiccups due to some fitment issues with the swap; the steering linkage and gear box location. I was able to modify the steering link to get the clearance I needed, notched the frame and inch on both sides to fit the headers, along with rerouting the exhaust to fit around the gear box. The fuel pump was originally a mechanical fuel pump operated by the engine however, I needed to supply the new engine with a constant feed of fuel from the old tank. This was executed through a returnless system with an external fuel pump operated by the computer. Overall I had a blast with the build and am looking forward to my next project.

I knew the Honda CB750 was a great choice, as it would have plenty of power and great support for the chassis. I found one on Craigslist and the seller and I agreed on a deal. The front end was bent from a wreck and the bike didn’t run, but the seller seemed trustworthy, so I took a chance on it. Fortunately, I had a gsxr front end laying around from a previous project that was never completed due to a bad engine, so I had the required parts to start the build. All I needed was the triple tree conversion spindle and a set of bearings to make it work with the frame, a little wiring for the controls and I’d be good to go. Alas, I was off on another build project. I already knew what I wanted it to look like so I got to work hacking away at the frame. I removed the rear triangle, bent a new seat hoop, made a battery tray, rewired the harness, swapped the cluster for an updated, all inclusive, single gauge and built a 4:2 exhaust. I wanted the look and top end power band of the filter pods, so I decided to fully rebuild the carbs and get them all balanced up. I found out the previous owner attempted the same thing and broke a few of the jets (I had a great time getting those out). After a few attempts with different jets, I was able to get it running smoothy, and let me tell you, the bike was incredibly fast and loud. I’m not a ‘true’ motorcycle enthusiast but I had a blast with the build. The bike turned into a glorified scooter, as I was too afraid to take it out on the interstate. The minimalistic, sleek style of a this cafe racer will forever hold a special place in my heart.
